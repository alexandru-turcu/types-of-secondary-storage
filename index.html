  <h2>Types of Memory and Storage</h2>

  <p>Computers require some form of memory and storage.</p>

  <p>
    Memory is usually referred to as the internal devices which the computers can access directly.
    <br>
    This memory can be the user's workspace, temporary data or data that is key to running the computer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Storage devices can also be removable to allow data, for example, to be transferred between computers.
    <br>
    Removable devices allow a user to store important data in a different building in case of data loss.
  </p>

  <p>However, all of this has become a lot less important with the advent of technology such as ‘data drop’ (which uses Bluetooth) and cloud storage.</p>
  
  <p>
    Internal memory includes components such as registers (which are part of the processor).
    <br>
    There is also memory cache (which is external to the processor); this is used to store data which the processor will probably need to use again.
  </p>
