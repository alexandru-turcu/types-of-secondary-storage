  <h4>How they work: </h4>
  <p>  There are 2 types of SSD gates, NAND and NOR. NAND gate SSDs are cheaper to make but are a bit slower than NOR gate SSDs </p>
  <p>  NAND gate SSDs use flash memory cells which work by "trapping" an electron in a floating gate, hence the name "flash memory". </p>
  <p>  NOR gate SSDs are called EEPROMS. </p>

  <p>  NOTE: nowadays both NOR and NAND SSDs use flash memory cells, but the book says only NAND uses them. </p>

  <h4>Advantages: </h4>
  <p>  • Faster</p>
  <p>  • Lighter</p>
  <p>  • More reliable (no moving parts)</p>
  <p>  • Smaller</p>
  <p>  • Low power consumption</p>
  <br>
  
  <h4>Disadvantages: </h4>
  <p>  • High cost per GB</p>
  <p>  • Limited amount of write cycles</p>

  <h3 id="optical">Optical media: CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs</h3>
  <br>
  <h4>How they work: </h4>
  <p>  Optical drives use lasers to read and write data. The lasers burn tiny pits onto the surface of the disk whcih can later be read by a weaker laser (that will not change the shape of the disk). </p>
  <p>  Data is read by measuring the amount of light reflected back. </p>
  <p>  Optical media is usually used as a back-up system due to its durability but slow read speeds.</p>
  <br>

  
  <h3>There are 3 main types of optical storage: </h4>
  <br>

  
  <h4>CDs: </h4>
  <p>  CDs have the lasers with the biggest wavelengths (780nm), so they need more space to store the same amount of data. </p>
  <p>  They are usually used to store music as they cannot store anything larger like movies or games</p>
  <br><br>

  
  <h4>DVDs: </h4>
  <p>  DVDs have 650nm laser wavelengths, which is between the 2 other optical storage types</p>
  <p>  DVDs use a special technology called dual layering, which allows having twice as much data store in the same amount of space. </p>
  <p>  The laser can change focal length to read only 1 of the layers at a time, however birefringence (keyword) can occur which is when the focal length is between the 2 layers. </p>
  <p>  THis can cause light to refract into 2 separate beams which gives unreadable data. </p>

  <br>
  <h4>Blu-Rays: </h4>
  <p>  Blu-Rays have by far the smallest wavelengths (408nm) since they use blue light instead of red. They can store the most amount of data in the same amount of space. </p>
  <p>  They are used to store movies, games, etc.</p>
  <br><br>
  
  <h4>Advantages: </h4>
  <p>  • Durable</p>
  <p>  • Easy to transport</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Disadvantages: </h4>
  <p>  • Low storage capacity</p>
  <p>  • Slow read/write speeds</p>
  <p>  • Can be easily damaged</p>
